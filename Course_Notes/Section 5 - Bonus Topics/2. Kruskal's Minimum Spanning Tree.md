What is minimum spanning tree?
- subset of edges that connects to all nodes
- with the lowest cost possible (assuming weighted edges)

Minimum spanning trees are not always unique. There could be many even with the same cost.

## Steps
1. Sort edges by ascending weight
2. Walk through edges, observing node pairs. 
	1. If both nodes unified in same group, don't include this edge.
	2. Otherwise, include edge and unify nodes.
		1. In the case where one node is already unified, the un-unified node joins that union.
		2. If both are in different unions, we combine the two unions.
3. Terminate when every edge is processed or all nodes unified.

Doing this also has the outcome of creating a subgraph with no cycles!

It doesn't make sense to do this on a directed graph, as the tree created is not directed.

Also, all nodes must be connected first. No floaters.
