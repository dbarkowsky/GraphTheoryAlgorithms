Also known as Disjoint Set

Keeps track of elements that can be split into one or more disjoint sets.
Has two primary operations:
- find: what group does x belong to?
- union: merge two groups together

Where do you use this?
- Grid percolation: path from bottom to top of grid
- network connectivity
- least common ancestor in trees
- image processing
- Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm

Very good complexity. Pretty much everything is near-constant (amortized contant) time.
