- Isomorphic trees are ones that are structurally identical
	- e.g. A pentagram can be unfolded to be a pentagon. Same nodes with same connections though.
- More scientifically:
	- If there's a bisection between the sets of both nodes
	- Needs to be a function that can map tree 1 to tree 2 and back.

## How to check this?
- Can make a hash of a tree's structure:
	- Good for complex trees because they're fast
	- Bad because they are error prone
- Serialize tree and uniquely encode
	- What does this look like?
- Examples from the video use rooted trees
	- So have to find the root first
	- They have to be the same root on both trees!

## How Details
1. Find centre of both trees (assuming one centre)
2. Root trees at centre nodes
3. Serialize the trees into binary (can be left/right brackets)
	1. AHU algorithm:
		1. Assign all leaf nodes pairs of () brackets
		2. Loop:
			1. For any node that has had all its child nodes evaluated
			2. Assign it the brackets filled with its children's evaluations
				1. e.g. parent = (()()) when it has two leaf children
			3. But, children's evaluations must be sorted
				1. e.g. child 1 = (), child 2 = (()), but parent is now ((())())
				2. child 2 came before child 1 because sorted by size
				3. ensures uniqueness
