- Used as subroutine in other algorithms
- Can be used in the previous exercise to find a good node to make the root
- There can only be 1 or 2 centres. 
	- 2 centres when there are two nodes that are equally weighted to be the centre
		- I see this as the edge between them is the true centre
- Centre is always middle node (or 2 middle nodes) along longest path of a graph
	- So this doesn't only apply to trees

## How to find?
- Could remove outer layers of nodes, repeating until we only have the centre nodes left.
	- Leaf nodes removed first
