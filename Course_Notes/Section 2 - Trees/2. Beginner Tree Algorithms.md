## How to get sum of leaf nodes?
- Traverse tree, keep values if node has no children
- Can be done with BFS or DFS

## How to determine tree height?
i.e. Number of edges from root to furthest leaf + 1
- Every node's height is the max height of its children + 1
- Ideally work from the leafs up here.
