- Can help to add structure to a tree
- Gives tree directed edges instead of undirected ones

Can root using any node, but not every node will make the tree well balanced, so...

- Easier when each node has an id, parent pointer, and list of children pointers
- Doesn't really matter which node we pick unless we want balance
