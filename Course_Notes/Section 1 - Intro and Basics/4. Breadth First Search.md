Time complexity: O(vertices + edges)
Very useful for shortest path on unweighted graphs.

Explores all neighbour nodes before their children. 
Essentially creeps forward in waves.

DFS is more like a blitzkrieg.

Uses a queue to line up the nodes next to be searched.
When we visit a node, we queue its unvisited children.
As long as the queue is full, we continue to search.
