- Nodes and edges (their relationships)

Types of Graphs
- Undirected Graph:
	- Edges have no orientation. e.g. Nodes A and B are connected, but no direction, like 2-way street.
- Directed Graph:
	- Directed edges. e.g. Node A gives a gift to B. There is a direction here.
- Weighted Graphs:
	- Edges between nodes now have weights. Could be cost, distance, etc.

Note: Tuplet shows the edge of a graph (u, v, w)
- u = from
- v = to
- w = orientation

Special Graphs:
- Tree:
	- Doesn't contain any cycles (loops)
- Rooted Tree:
	- Same as tree, but has designated root
	- All edges point away from root node
	- Root doesn't have to be visually at the top.
- Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG):
	- No cycles, directed
	- Sort of a tree, but multiple nodes can point to a single node
- Bipartite Graph:
	- Where a graph can be evenly split so two groups can be formed with each node in a group only connecting to a node from another group.
	- No odd-length cycles here
	- e.g. Graph of people and jobs where only relationship is works at
		- People don't connect to people. Jobs don't connect to jobs.
- Complete Graphs:
	- Unique edge between all nodes
	- e.g. Each node connected to every other node directly
	- This is computationally not good.

Representing Graphs
- Adjacency Matrix
	- Size of matrix depends on number of nodes
	- ![[Pasted image 20241031160007.png]]
	- The values are the cost of moving between nodes.
	- Can lookup weights very quickly, but iterating takes a lot of time and also space to store.
- Adjacency List
	- Instead of a matrix, use a Map
	- ![[Pasted image 20241031160203.png]]
	- Space efficient for non-complete graphs.
	- Weight lookup is a bit longer.
- Edge List
	- Represents as unordered list of edges
	- ![[Pasted image 20241031160336.png]]
	- This is the tuplet format.
	- Efficient for small graphs.
	- Bad for big graphs and edge lookup times.
