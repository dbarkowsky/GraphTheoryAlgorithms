Most common problem: Shortest Path Problem
- Assumes nodes have weights on edges, possibly directional
- Many algos for this
	- BFS, Djikstra's, A*, etc.

Simpler problem: are the nodes even connected?

Is there a negative cycle?
- This is a cycle where moving through the graph accumulates negative weight. 
	- e.g. First move is +1, second +2, but then third is -4 and that brings us back to the start.
	- This can be a bad scenario if we're trying to find a shortest path.

Are there strongly-connected components?
- These are nodes that form smaller cycles within a graph.
- It's possible to have a component with a node size of 1 if it has an edge back to itself.

Travelling Salesman Problem
- What's the shortest path to visit all the nodes in a graph?

Finding a Bridge Edge
- An edge which if cut, would separate a node or group of nodes entirely from the graph

Finding Articulation Points
- Same, but targets nodes, not edges

Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
- Try to find the edges that could be used to connect the graph as a tree with the lowest possible cost of edges.
- Basically efficient conversion to a tree.
- Not always a single answer here.

Network Flow
- What's the maximum amount of capacity we can fit through the graph at one time.
- Think of this as cars travelling on streets or water in pipes.
- Infinite input is assumed. Where is the bottleneck?
