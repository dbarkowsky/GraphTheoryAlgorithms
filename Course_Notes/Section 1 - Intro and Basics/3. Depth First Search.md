- Traversal algorithm
- O(vertices + edges) time complexity
- Explores nodes and edges well.

Basic DFS
- Can start on any node. 
- Pick one edge and follow
- Continue this pattern until a dead end is reached or a node that has already been seen is hit
- Backtrack to last node, check if edges unexplored
- If so, follow that edge
- If no edges to explore, backtrack more
- Eventually will backtrack to starting node

Connected Components
- Not necessarily directly, but via other nodes
- Can use DFS for this as well, but...
	- Must check all nodes to see if visited
	- If not visited, start DFS at that node
	- Track traversal and use this to group nodes until all nodes in group explored
	- Find next unvisited node and repeat until all nodes are visited
