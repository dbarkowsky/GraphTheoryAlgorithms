There are M mice in the field and a hungry owl watching.
There are also H holes scattered around, each with a different mouse capacity.
A mouse can run a distance of D to any hole before being caught.

Which holes can the mouse reach?
Any holes within this distance means that there's an edge between the mouse node and the hole node.

Ideally, we're trying to get as many mice to safety as possible. 
This is a bipartite graph, as each mouse connects to at least one hole.

Some steps:
- Create your mouse nodes and your hole nodes. 
	- Could do this in an array if mice take up 0 to M -1 indexes and holes M to M + H -1.
- Create edges between mice and holes they can reach with a capacity of 1.
- Create source node with edges to mice (capacity 1 because one hole for each mouse max).
- Create sink node with edges to holes (capacity equal to how many mice it can hold)

The problem at this point is set up in a way that you can create a flow graph and use the algorithm from [[1. Max Flow - Ford Fulkerson]]. The only real work here is translating the word problem into a usable graph.
