This is a specific version of [[1. Max Flow - Ford Fulkerson]] that uses different way to find the augmented paths.

DFS in previous version makes the time complexity potentially bad if there are specific combinations of flow capacity. Unlikely in reality, but still a possibility.

Edmonds Karp uses BFS instead, bringing time complexity from O(edge * flow) to O(node * edge^2), which is capacity agnostic.

Generally, finds the shortest path from source to sink for every iteration.

## Steps
1. BFS from source to sink. Only take a path if its remaining capacity is > 0.
2. Find bottle neck value along this shortest path and augment flow values by this amount.
3. Continue finding paths and augmenting flow until flow is maxed out. Remember, if an edge has no remaining capacity, we don't have to follow it.

When all paths exhausted, max flow is all the flow entering the sink.
