- Uses topological ordering to determine in O(nodes + edges) time
- After getting topological graph:
	1. Have list of nodes with values for shortest route to that node (start at infinity)
	2. For each node in order, evaluate its edges to other nodes
	3. Mark them as shortest path to that node (previous cost + this edge cost) if lower than existing value
	4. This should give the shortest path to each node by the end
