Finds the shortest path between all pairs of nodes
Time complexity: O(V^3)

When to use:
- Small graphs
- There's negative cycles
- When you need all pairs shortest paths

When not to use:
- Any other time.
- Medium or bigger graphs

Best to represent graph as an adjacency matrix. 
- Each entry will have a list with length of total nodes, where the value is the edge weight between them.
- Use Infinity in cases where two nodes do not connect directly
- This matrix is essentially a cache
	- Could it then be stored as a Map instead?

Result is a matrix with all the costs of getting from node A to node B
Can also use this to retrace the path and get the shortest path.
