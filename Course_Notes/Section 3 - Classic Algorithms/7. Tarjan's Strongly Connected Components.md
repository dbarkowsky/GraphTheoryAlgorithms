SCCs: self-contained cycles within a directed graph. Every vertex can reach every other vertex.

This could potentially be an SCC of one node, which only reaches itself.

Low-link value: smallest node id reachable from that node, including its own id.
- Find this value via DFS.
- All nodes with the same low-link value may be in a SCC group, but it's highly dependant on the traversal order, so we can't use this.

Tarjan's algorithm gets around this by tracking possible valid nodes from which you can update low-link value. This is often as a stack.
- Nodes are added to the stack the first time they're explored.
- Nodes are removed from the stack when a complete SCC is found.

So, to update a low-link value of node A to match node B's value, there must be a path to B and B must be on the stack.
Do this during the DFS to keep linear time complexity.

## Algorithm
1. Mark each node as unvisited.
2. Start DFS. When visiting a node, assign its id as low-link value. Mark this node as visited and add to "seen" stack.
3. On DFS callback, if previous node is on the stack, take min of current and last node low-link value.
4. After visiting all neighbours, if the current node is the start of a SCC (its low-link value equals its id), pop nodes off the stack until current node is reached. 

NOTE: Why not use a set or map for the stack?
- Because we need to be able to track the order we inserted items on the stack. They must pop off in order.
